I created a classic game using windows forms asp.net.
The player's goal is to jump on a platform, collect all the coins and reach the door while avoiding being caught by enemies which would
mean game over, the player has to also avoid falling off the platform because that would also mean game over.
The player can only win the game once all the coins have been collected and player has reached the door.

to jump-spacebar
to move left/Right-use left and right arrow buttons on keyboard
to jump over enemies/jump on platform-spacebar+arrow button
